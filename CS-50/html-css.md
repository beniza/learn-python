## Making a Responsive Design
Strategies to make a website behave differently on a user's device based on the type of devices he/she uses. Below are a few such strategies.

### Viewport
### Media Queries
A media query is a specific way of assigning CSS not to a particular HTML element, but to a particular HTML
element on a particular type of media.
So that type of media might be particularly-sized computers, or particularly-sized phones, or even the difference between how
you want a website to look when you are writing the code for it to appear on a screen versus how you want the website to look if someone prints it out, for example, on a printer.

```html
<style>
  @media print {
    .screen-only {
      display: none;
    }
  }
</style>
```
### Flexbox
### Grids
